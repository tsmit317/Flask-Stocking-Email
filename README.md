# [NC Trout Stocking Alert](https://pages.github.com/)

A simple web app designed to alert users when their favorite streams are stocked with trout.

## How it works

Everyday at 1:30PM, the app pulls data from the [NC Wildlife Resources Commission online stocking updates website](https://www.ncpaws.org/PAWS/Fish/Stocking/Schedule/OnlineSchedule.aspx) via web scraping using Pythonâ€™s Beautiful Soup library. 
If there have been any stockings for the day, the application then queries its database to create a list of users who have selected counties which were stocked. 
Emails are then sent to each user in the list using the smtplib module.

## Motivation

Typically the NC Wildlife Resources Commission releases an annual trout stocking schedule on their website, informing the public of when and what streams will be stocked. 
Unfortunately, COVID-19 threw a wrench in the stocking schedule. 
While NCWRC does post daily stocking updates online, it requires individuals to check the website everyday to see if their local/favorite streams have been stocked. 
Thus the idea to create an automated email notification was born.
